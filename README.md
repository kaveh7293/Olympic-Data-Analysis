# Olympic-Data-Analysis
* In this exmple, I tried to analysis the data of different olympic games using python. This data analysis contains information regarding the number of medals that teams obtained during all the previous olympics. I added the average temeprature of differnet countries and their GDP to realize whether there is any pattern between the olympic success and these additional features.

* The data were collected using BeautifulSoup library in python from wikipedia website. The data for number of medals for different countries, the GDP and average temperature were collected separately and then concatenated to obtain a pandas data from. 

* In the first step, I did some visualization to obtain some of the questions that I had about olympic game results stats. In the first graph, I plotted the number of gold medals for both of summer and winter olympic games and the total number of medals (i.e., gold, silver and bronze) during all the olympic games for both of summer and winter olympic games. As shown, the data were only visualized for the best 10 countries in both of summer and winter olympics.
