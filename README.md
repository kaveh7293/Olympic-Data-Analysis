# Olympic-Data-Analysis
# In this exmple, I tried to analysis the data of different olympic games using python. This data analysis contains information regarding the number of medals that teams obtained during all the previous olympics. I added the average temeprature of differnet countries and their GDP to realize whether there is any pattern between the olympic success and these additional features.
